# wedding-site

The repo for the site that Larah and I created together for our wedding 🎉

## To do

1. [ ] Create Invitations page
1. [ ] Create "Attendee Preparation" page
1. [ ] Create Venue Information page
1. [ ] Implement password-protection for the domain

## Considerations

* Many family members are financially unable to fund the trip themselves - Costs include:
    * Air travel
    * Shuttle fares (or Rental vehicle)
    * Food costs (on-site options are expensive and limited)
    * Warm & waterproof clothing (DO NOT BUY IN TOWN - very expensive)
        * Good brands include Columbia, Patagonia and more - these are "name brand", but good sales can be found (_outside_ of Breckenridge)
    * 

## Pages

### Invitations Page

* Directory of invitees and their RSVP status
    * Some form of user management; they should be able to see what their status is, but not everyone else's
    * Only admins should be able to see 


### Attendee Preparation Page

This page should cover all the bases for what's needed for the trip to Breckenridge. We should do what we can to make travel easier, but there will
likely be logistical challenges to face.

#### Travel

We need to include the following information in a "Travel" section of the Attendee Preparation page:

##### From Denver International Airport

You have two primary options when traveling to Breckenridge from Denver International Airport:
1. **Shuttle Transit**
    * Less stressful as you don't need to worry about driving yourself in snowy conditions
    * Less expensive than vehicle rental
    * Pick up locations are available on-site at the airport
    * Travel time to venue is about 2.5 hours
    * Options include [Summit Express](https://www.summitexpress.com/) and [Mountain Shuttle](https://www.mountainshuttle.com/) (among others)
1. **Rental vehicle** (not advised - see "If Driving Yourself" section below)
    * Not _as much_ of a concern when renting, _so long as you make sure you select a vehicle with the appropriate options_
    * Generally-speaking, you'd need to rent a compact or full-size SUV (the heavier, the better) _and it must have either 4WD or AWD_
    * Driving in snowy conditions is risky; braking and turning can lead to sliding, if not careful
    * Rental lots are _not_ on-site at the airport; you must take a shuttle to your selected rental service
    * Only take this option if you are absolutely insistent on not taking/depending on a shuttle for travel (the lodge has it's own shuttle and 
    there are free shuttles around town)
    * Travel time to venus is about 1.5 to 2.5 hours, depending on traffic and weather conditions

The travel time in the shuttle is always longer (according to Google). The route shuttles take appears to always longer than if you drive yourself;
shuttles don't appear to take IH-70 for a portion of the trip, but it's faster to do so if you drive yourself. However, keep in mind that this comes
with much more risk on your part as you're responsible for ensuring your vehicle adheres to 
[Colorado's Traction Law](https://www.codot.gov/travel/winter-driving/tractionlaw).

##### If Driving Yourself (not advised)

Driving yourself is not advised since most (if not all) attendees are from Texas; this is a very long drive. Additionally, _unless you've prepared 
for the trip, specifically_, it's unlikely your vehicle adheres to [Colorado's Traction Law](https://www.codot.gov/travel/winter-driving/tractionlaw).

From the Colorado Government website:

> During winter storms, or when conditions require, CDOT will implement the Passenger Vehicle Traction Law. CDOT 
> can implement the Passenger Vehicle Traction and Chain Laws on any state highway. During a Traction Law, all 
> motorists are required to have EITHER:
> 
> 1. 4WD or AWD vehicle and 3/16” tread depth
> 1. Tires with a mud and snow designation (M+S icon) and 3/16” tread depth 
> 1. Winter tires (mountain-snowflake icon) and 3/16” tread depth 
> 1. Tires with an all-weather rating by the manufacturer and 3/16” tread depth
> 1. Chains or an approved alternative traction device

You should only drive yourself if your vehicle meets the appropriate criteria **and you're comfortable driving in snowy conditions**. 

Please note that _you will be expected to know how to chain your tires should the need arise_. Chains are only required under 
specific conditions, and Chaining Stations are provided along the route on IH-70. There are many small towns along the route
to stop at, should weather become too dangerous to proceed even with chains.

If you do not follow these guidelines and an accident occurs, you could be held accountable and fined.

##### Inclement Weather Concerns

While unlikely, it's not impossible that an unexpected storm could hinder travel either to or from Breckenridge. If such an event occurs, shuttles 
may not be running and it would be unsafe to drive yourself. Snowy weather itself is not enough to stop travel, but if the accumulation is 
significant enough, delays and road blockages may occur. Shuttle vehicles are equipped to operate in snowy weather conditions and are unlikely stop
service, barring a severe weather event.

In the off-chance that travel prevents wedding guests from leaving Breckenridge, it may become necessary to extend your stay by an extra day. Should
that occur, we'll work with hotel staff to see what arrangements can be made and go from there.

#### Personal Care

When traveling to the mountains, you'll need to make preparations for the following conditions:
1. **Low oxygen**
    * Expect to feel winded easily from relatively minimal physical activities
    * The Lodge has elevators, so there is no need to haul heavy bags up/down stairs
1. **Low humidity**
    * Expect dry eyes, mouth, nose, throat, etc.
    * Bring plenty of water, lotion, eye drops and chapstick (all of which can be bought at the local Grocery store - prices are reasonable there)
1. **Lots of snow**
    * Wear warm clothing that is _waterproof_; the snow will melt on you and can easily-soak clothing (especially socks, if your shoes aren't waterproof)
    * Bring sunglasses - snow is much brighter than you'd expect

#### Clothing Recommendations

##### Wedding Attire

_TBD; we don't even know what we'll be wearing yet_

##### General Clothing Recommendations

* Beanie
* Waterproof Pants, Jacket, gloves and boots
* Fleece jacket as a layer underneath your waterproof jacket (if needed)

When out and about in Breckenridge, it's possible (even likely) that there will be a significant amount of snow. It does not evenly-accumulate, so some
areas will be much deeper than others, even if there's only been 1" accumulation. It's not unlikely that you'll step in a snow bank that goes up to your
ankle while walking around town. If you aren't wearing waterproof, warm clothing, this can make you dangerously wet and cold very quickly.

#### Dining Options

The Lodge at Breckendridge has an on-site restaurant, Traverse,  that's open from 7-10am for breakfast and 4-9 for dinner. Breakfast is included 
in the resort fee, so anyone staying at the venue can eat there without additional cost. Dinner is not included with the resort fee; Traverse's dinner
prices are a bit high and the options are a bit limited.

There are many restaurants in Breckenridge, but many are closed by 6pm or 7pm. Many of them are available for delivery through Door Dash or Uber Eats,
in case the shuttle is not available, or you don't want to drive. Given the odd hours for some restaurants, it's not a bad idea to buy some snacks 
and drinks for your room (there is a refrigerator in each room).
